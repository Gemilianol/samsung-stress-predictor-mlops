# üìä Stress Score Prediction Application (Samsung Health Data)

This is a personal, educational project that predicts, on real time, your daily stress score based on heart and stress metrics which the user can provide through a form,  primary from his Samsung Health account data.

## üîß Project Structure

- `backend/`: Python + Flask backend for ML predictions
- `frontend/`: React.js client UI
- `data/`: Raw/processed data (excluded from Git)
- `models/`: Trained model artifacts (excluded from Git)
- `logs/`: Training metrics logs (excluded from Git)
- `notebooks/`: Exploration and offline feature selection

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- End-to-End ML pipeline: data ingestion, transformation, training, prediction
- Feature engineering using domain knowledge
- Model selection and monitoring with `train_pipeline.py`
- React UI + Flask backend integration
- Docker-ready architecture (optional)

## üìù Notes about the project

‚ö†Ô∏è Feature selection was performed offline using Random Forest importance. For simplicity, we use a fixed set of features and 3 lagged versions. Future work may explore dynamic feature selection pipelines.

‚ö†Ô∏è In this first stage of the project and for simplicity purposes, I've avoid used MLflow for track runs due to the classical problems with Docker Compose and model persistence. 'Models not persisting between runs (Neither if the model is saved in a volume, in this way you will have problems with the URIs) so you are force to re train the model every time that you run the Docker Compose and this task it's time and computing consuming.

## üöß Development Stage

This is the first development version. CI/CD, MLflow, monitoring, and orchestration will be added in future iterations.
