# üìä Stress Score Prediction App (Samsung Health Data)

This personal, educational project predicts your **daily stress score in real time** based on heart and stress metrics provided by the user, primarily exported from **Samsung Health**.

---

## üîß Project Structure

- `backend/`: Flask-based API serving ML predictions
- `frontend/`: React.js client UI
- `data/`: Raw and processed data *(excluded from Git)*
- `models/`: Trained model artifacts *(excluded from Git)*
- `logs/`: Model training logs *(excluded from Git)*
- `notebooks/`: EDA and offline feature engineering

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- End-to-end ML pipeline: data ingestion, transformation, training, prediction
- Feature engineering using domain knowledge
- Model monitoring and retraining logic via `train_pipeline.py`
- React + Flask integration for real-time interaction
- Docker-ready architecture *(optional setup)*

## üß™ Development Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Feature selection** was performed offline using Random Forest importance. For simplicity, this version uses a fixed feature set and 3 lagged versions. Future work will include dynamic feature selection pipelines.

‚ö†Ô∏è **MLflow** is not integrated in this initial version due to common persistence issues with Docker Compose and volume-based URI management. Retraining is required each time containers restart, which is time-consuming. This will be addressed in future iterations.

‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è **config.py**  src/components/config.py is a placeholder for CI and that production config is kept externally; this documents the approach.

## üöß Development Status

This is **Version 1 (MVP)**. The following enhancements are planned:

- [x] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] MLflow-based experiment tracking and model registry
- [ ] Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
- [ ] Orchestration with Airflow or Prefect
- [ ] Full Docker Compose / Kubernetes deployment
